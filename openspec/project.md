# Project Context

## Purpose
Prompt Memo is a cross-platform application designed to help users save, organize, and retrieve AI prompts along with their result samples. The app serves as a personal knowledge base for AI interactions, enabling users to build a library of effective prompts and reference outputs.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter (for cross-platform support)
- **Language**: Dart
- **Local Storage**: SQLite (via sqflite package)
- **State Management**: Provider/Riverpod
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem (with future Git-based cloud sync)
- **Blob Storage**: File-based storage for result samples (txt, images, videos)
- **Platforms**: Windows, Android (with future expansion to iOS, macOS, Linux, Web)

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- Follow Dart official style guide (dart format)
- Use descriptive names with camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes/types
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep widgets small and focused (<200 lines)
- Use meaningful comments for complex business logic

### Architecture Patterns
- **MVVM pattern**: Model-View-ViewModel for separation of concerns
- **Repository pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Service locator**: For dependency injection
- **Feature-first structure**: Organize code by features (prompt-management, search, export, etc.)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic (>=90% coverage)
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- Golden tests for UI consistency
- Use mockito for mocking dependencies

### Git Workflow
- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Commit format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(prompt): add search functionality`)
- PR reviews required for all changes
- Semantic versioning for releases

## Domain Context
- **Prompt**: Text input given to AI models
- **Result Sample**: Output generated by AI for a given prompt, stored as files (txt, images, videos)
- **Collection**: Organized group of related prompts
- **Tags**: User-defined labels for categorization
- **Blob Storage**: File-based storage for result samples, extensible for future Git-based sync

## Important Constraints
- Offline-first design: Core functionality must work without internet
- Performance: Search across 10,000+ prompts must be <500ms
- Storage: Local database size should not exceed 100MB for 10,000 prompts (excluding blob files)
- File storage: Result samples stored as separate files in filesystem, designed for future Git-based sync
- Cross-platform consistency: UI/UX must be identical across platforms
- Accessibility: Support for screen readers and keyboard navigation

## External Dependencies
- Flutter SDK (stable channel)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter plugins
- For Windows: Visual Studio 2022 with C++ development tools
- Optional: Google Drive/OneDrive APIs for cloud sync (future feature)
